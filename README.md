The Task Manager app constantly evolving to meet its full potential !

The Task Manager App is a simple yet powerful web application built using ReactJS that helps you manage your tasks and stay organized. 
With an intuitive user interface and essential features, this app is designed to streamline your task management process.

Features:

Task List: The app provides a clean and organized list that displays all your tasks. This list makes it easy to see what tasks you have on your plate and what needs your attention.

Task Creation: Adding new tasks is a breeze. Simply type in the name of your task and hit enter or click the "Add Task" button. Your new task will be added to the list, complete with a date stamp.

Adding Task Notes: It's a quick and intuitive way to keep your task-related information organized.

Task Date: When you create a new task, the app automatically adds a date stamp to it. This helps you keep track of when the task was added or when it's due.

Task Status: You can categorize tasks with different statuses: New, Processing, or Done. Each status is visually distinct, making it easy to differentiate between tasks that are in progress and those that are completed.

Task Filtering: To streamline your task management, the app allows you to filter tasks based on their status. You can choose to view:

    All Tasks: Displays all tasks regardless of their status.
    New Tasks: Shows only tasks that are marked as "New."
    Processing Tasks: Filters tasks that are in the "Processing" status.
    Done Tasks: Focuses on tasks that have been marked as "Done."

Task Deletion: If you've completed a task or decided that it's no longer necessary, the app enables you to delete tasks with a simple click. This feature keeps your task list tidy and clutter-free.

The chart in Task Manager app provides a visual representation of task statuses, making it easy to see the distribution of tasks across "Done," "Processing," and "New" categories at a glance. 
It offers a quick overview of your task management progress, helping you stay organized and focused.
